    "# Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection to Extract Password Hashes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I developed a simple Python script to demonstrate a blind Boolean-based SQL injection attack. The script targets a vulnerable web application running locally (http://127.0.0.1:5000) and attempts to extract the password hash of a user by exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `username` parameter.\n",

    "The approach follows a structured attack:\n",
    "1. **Check if a user exists**.\n",

    "Structured Approach: The script uses a structured approach: first, checking if the user exists, then calculating the password length, and finally extracting the password hash character by character. This is a well-organized method for handling blind SQL injection.\n",

    "This project provided a hands-on way to learn about SQL injection, specifically blind Boolean-based attacks. By testing various conditions to infer information, I was able to extract a password hash from a vulnerable web application. This exercise reinforced the importance of secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities."
